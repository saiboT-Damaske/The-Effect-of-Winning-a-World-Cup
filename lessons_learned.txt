Lessons Learned
===============

1. Two competing effects when computing YoY for the paper sample
----------------------------------------------------------------
The paper's estimation sample uses Δ4 log GDP growth, which requires a
4-quarter lag.  There are two groups of countries that behave differently:

  a) EARLY-START countries (OECD data from 1960-Q1, paper window 1961+):
     The paper does NOT include 1961 YoY values.  Even though 1960 data
     exists in OECD, the paper's effective first YoY quarter is 1962-Q1
     (whose lag at 1961-Q1 is the first quarter in the stated window).
     This means the paper treats the sample window as the boundary for
     lag availability.

  b) LATE-START countries (BRA 1998-Q2, ARG 1993-Q1, RUS 1995-Q1, CHL 1996-Q1):
     The paper DOES include their first 4 quarters of YoY.  For example,
     Brazil's GDP series "starts" at 1998-Q2 per Table A1, but OECD has
     Brazilian GDP from 1996-Q1.  So the YoY at 1998-Q2 uses the 1997-Q2
     lag (available in OECD but before the stated start date).

The correct approach (variant E in investigate_missing_8_obs.R):
  - Keep master-panel YoY (computed on all available OECD data)
  - Apply per-country effective start dates:
      * Most countries: 1962-Q1 (not 1961-Q1)
      * BRA: 1998-Q2, ARG: 1993-Q1, RUS: 1995-Q1, CHL: 1996-Q1
  - Then filter for non-NA YoY

This yields W=1295, NW=7338 (paper: W=1295, NW=7342).  The 4 missing
non-winner obs are likely Russia, whose OECD data in our download ends
in 2020 rather than 2021.

2. The paper only documents series ranges for a few countries
-------------------------------------------------------------
Table A1 in Mello (2024) lists the GDP start quarter only for countries
whose series begin later than 1961-Q1 (BRA, ARG, RUS, CHL).  For the
majority of countries the paper simply states "1961-Q1" as the start,
without explaining that YoY growth is only defined from 1962-Q1 onward.
This is an implicit convention: the sample window defines when lags are
available, not external data availability — but only for the 1960-start
countries.  Late-start countries use external OECD data for their lags.

3. Observation counts as a diagnostic
-------------------------------------
Comparing observation counts (winners / non-winners) against the paper's
Table 1 is a quick way to verify correct sample construction.

  Paper:     W = 1,295    NW = 7,342    Total = 8,637
  Ours:      W = 1,295    NW = 7,338    Total = 8,633

The initial ~24-obs discrepancy (1315 vs 1295 winners) pointed to the
1961 YoY issue.  The remaining 4 non-winner obs are attributable to
Russia's shorter OECD series in our data download.

4. Pipeline history
-------------------
  v1: YoY computed on full OECD → trim to 1961+  →  too many obs (1315 W)
  v2: trim to 1961+ → recompute YoY in window    →  too few obs (1291 W)
  v3: master YoY + Table A1 start dates           →  correct (1295 W)
