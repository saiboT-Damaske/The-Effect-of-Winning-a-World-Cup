Abstract
This paper uses OECD data to examine whether winning the men’s FIFA World Cup
boosts GDP growth, as claimed by analysts and media outlets concomitantly with every
edition of this football competition. By implementing both an event-study design and
a synthetic difference-in-difference strategy, the analysis shows that winning the World
Cup increases year-over-year GDP growth by at least 0.48 percentage points in the two
subsequent quarters. This result seems primarily driven by enhanced export growth, which
is consistent with a greater appeal enjoyed by national products and services on the global
market after victory in a major sporting event.

I. Introduction
It is commonly believed that winning the men’s FIFA World Cup leads to a boost in GDP
growth. This popular conviction relies on the idea that success in one of the globally most
viewed and prestigious sport competitions increases consumers’ and investors’ confidence
who, if spurred by the victory and moved by enhanced Keynesian animal spirits, have the
potential to affect the business cycle (Blanchard, 1993, Farmer and Guo, 1994). A 2018
Washington Times article argued that the winner of the 2018 World Cup final between
France and Croatia was bound ‘to get a nice boost in the pocketbook back home’.1 This
economic stimulus is at best believed to be very short-lived, since GDP growth generally
contracts in the year following the victory of the World Cup, a phenomenon that in 2014
Forbes called the ‘World Cup GDP Curse’.2
These insights are however based on simple and superficial glances at the national
GDP time series of the most recent World Cup winners. Hence, they do not bear any
causal interpretation, as they do not rely on a counterfactual scenario for how the GDP

growth rate of the same countries would have behaved had they not won the World Cup.
This lack of evidence is somehow surprising, considering that winning the World Cup is
by and large an unpredictable event influenced by factors that are unrelated to recent GDP
growth. As a result, the identification of the economic consequences of winning the World
Cup should be less prone to the endogeneity issues that usually characterize attempts to
estimate a treatment effect, whatever the latter may be.
Nevertheless, analyses on the World Cup have primarily investigated only whether
hosting the World Cup is beneficial to the national economy (Burgan and Mules, 1992,
Szymanski, 2010). Most studies in the literature are relatively pessimistic regarding
the effective economic returns of hosting mega sport events like the World Cup. For
instance, Baade and Matheson (2004) conclude that US host cities of the 1994 World
Cup experienced up to $9.3 billion in cumulative losses, contrarily to the expected
$4-billion gain. Similarly, Hagn and Maennig (2008) argue that the 1974 World Cup
held in Germany did not have long-term effects on employment. More optimistic figures
are provided by Lee and Taylor (2005), who examine the 2002 tournament held in
Japan and South Korea. Using survey data, the paper distinguishes between World Cup
and non-World Cup tourists to identify the economic stimulus brought by the former,
which the authors estimate to be of about $713 million of added value for South Korea.
However, such boost to the tourism sector is unlikely to cover the costs that come together
with hosting the World Cup; according to Peeters, Matheson, and Szymanski (2014),
each tourist attracted by the 2010 World Cup cost South Africa up to $13,000 in stadia
construction.
The Olympic Games are another major sport event widely studied in the literature.
Again, most efforts have been devoted to measure the economy of the Summer Olympics,
which also are likely to bring little economic benefits to the host country, especially
in the long run (see Billings and Holladay, 2012, Li, Blake, and Thomas, 2013,
Baade and Matheson, 2016).3 However, Rose and Spiegel (2011) show that already
submitting a bid to host the Olympic Games generates a permanent 20% rise in
trade, regardless of whether eventually the bid was successful or not. Furthermore,
Hotchkiss, Moore, and Zobay (2003) show that hosting the Games in 1996 increased
at least employment rates in the counties of Georgia which were close to Olympic
activity. Finally, Dolan et al. (2019) conclude that being the host city of the Olympic
Games has intangible positive consequences, such as an increase in residents’ life
satisfaction.
This paper contributes to this body of research by providing among the first evidence
on the economic effects of winning the World Cup. It implements an event-study design
that studies whether GDP growth increases in the quarters following the victory of the
World Cup, by comparing countries which won the tournament between 1961 and 2018
with a set of countries that, by contrast, did not win the Cup.4 It also provides a synthetic

A notable exception is Bernard and Busse (2004), who examined the determinants of Olympic success between
1960 and 1996. The authors find that population size and income per capita are relevant predictors of the number of
medals won at the Olympic Games. See also Donald (1972) and Grimes, Kelly, and Rubin (1974).
4 The main exceptions are Argentina (World Cup winner in 1978, 1986 and 2022) and Brazil (World Cup winner
in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002), for which quarterly data on GDP are available only since 1993 and 1996,
respectively. Since this study does not analyze the 2022 World Cup held in Qatar, Argentina will be classified

difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis by following the novel approach proposed by
Arkhangelsky et al. (2021), which allows an examination of the GDP growth rate of
winning countries and compares it with a counterfactual GDP time series created from
the set of control countries for the explicit purpose of satisfying the parallel trend
assumption.
Consistently with the conventional view, both approaches show that winning the
World Cup increases significantly GDP growth only in the two quarters following the
football competition. Possibly more surprisingly, this effect seems export-led rather than
driven by consumption growth or capital accumulation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the econometric
strategy and the data. Section III reports the results. Section IV tests their robustness.
Section V draws conclusions.

II. Econometric strategy
Event study

The baseline model estimated in this study consists of the following event-study
specification:
4 GDPc,t =



βl WINlc,t + θ1 HOSTc,t + ζ1 GDPc,t−4 + αc + μt + c,t ,

(1)

l,l=0

where 4 denotes the fourth-difference operator, while GDPc,t is the logged GDP of
country c in quarter t. Thus, this paper investigates the effects of winning the World Cup
on the GDP growth rate, which is computed by comparing logged GDP levels of a given
country in the same quarter of two consecutive years, that is, year-over-year (YoY) GDP
growth.5
The variables of interest are the relative-time indicators WINlc,t . They take value one
for country c being l quarters from winning the World Cup and 0 otherwise. For countries
that never won the World Cup in the period under study (i.e. the control countries), WINlc,t
are therefore always zero-valued. The only winning indicator excluded from (1) has l = 0,
which corresponds to the second quarter of the year when the Word Cup won by country
c took place.6 Importantly, the vector WINlc,t comprises two residual indicators, WIN−16

and WIN+16

through its 2002 World Cup success. See section II for more details.
GDP is not expressed in per-capita terms as population data at quarterly frequency are available only for a few
countries prior to the mid 1990s. Moreover, even population levels may be affected by a victory in a major sport
competition like the World Cup (see Fumarco and Principe, 2021).
6 Indeed, the World Cup has always taken place every four years between June and July, namely in between the
end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of a given year. The only exception was the last
completed World Cup, which is not part of the analysis; it was held in Qatar at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.

A Kick for the GDP


Bulletin

vector of coefficients βl will measure how winning the World Cup affects national GDP
growth for each quarter around the running of the football competition.
HOSTc,t denotes a control dummy for hosting the World Cup. It takes value one in
the year when country c hosted a World Cup and zero otherwise. Its inclusion in (1)
controls for the short-term economic effects of hosting the World Cup, which is a potential
confounding factor in the analysis. Indeed, hosting the World Cup may affect GDP growth
through the tourism inflow and the vast range of economic activities that are directly
associated with the running and organization of the tournament.
Instead, the inclusion of the fourth lag in logged GDP, GDPc,t−4 , on the right-hand
side of (1) controls for the fact that the likelihood of winning the World Cup appears
correlated with the size of the national economy. Indeed, only eight countries and
exclusively from Western Europe or South America (i.e. Argentina, Brazil, England,
France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Uruguay) won at least one of the 22 editions of
the World Cup. Moreover, the coefficient ζ1 provides a chance to test the so-called
conditional convergence hypothesis, namely to verify whether current GDP growth is
negatively related to past GDP levels (Barro, 1991, Barro and Sala-i Martin, 1992,
Mankiw, Romer, and Weil, 1992, Islam, 1995).7
αc are country-specific fixed effects and μt are quarter-specific fixed effects. The
former set of fixed effects accounts for unobserved and time-invariant country traits
that affect economic growth. Quarterly fixed effects control for global shocks to GDP
growth that hit all countries c on the same quarter. Finally, c,t is the error term, which
subsumes all residual time-varying and country-specific shocks to GDP growth. Because
the latter is computed by means of a fourth-difference transformation, which compares
two GDP records that are four calendar quarters distant from each other, c,t is not only
autocorrelated (as standard in a panel framework) but also likely to present a Moving
Average (MA) structure. Indeed, any significant determinant of GDP growth omitted from
Equation 1 and absorbed by c,t could propagate in time and affect even GDP growth
computed at the interim lags between t and t − 4.
This statistical pattern is likely to characterize any analysis that relies on a longdifference transformation. By measuring the difference between two non-consecutive
realizations of the outcome, long-differences inevitably introduce a MA component of
an order which is directly tied to that of the chosen data transformation. Here, this
issue gets possibly exacerbated by the spirit of the empirical strategy, which aims at
estimating a plausibly temporary in nature effect such as that of winning the World
Cup on GDP growth. Thus, failing to control for relevant shocks to GDP growth in the
period immediately preceding the World Cup may compromise the identification of the
event-study coefficients in the very short term following the treatment event. Equation (1)
shall be able to consistently estimate the vector of interest, βl , only under the condition that
all the existing residual shocks do not systematically hit World Cup winners. Contrarily,
any positive shock to GDP growth that also increases the chances of winning the World
7 As noted by Caselli, Esquivel, and Lefort (1996), the growth model (1) is equivalent to a dynamic equation
for (logged) GDP levels with a fourth lag on the right-hand side. In that case, the coefficient on lagged GDP is a
measure of persistence rather than the speed of convergence, but otherwise the models are statistically identical.

Cup (e.g. large investments in the national football sector) would represent a source of
upward bias in the treatment effects of interest potentially more serious than usual.
For this reason, it is important that the analysis appropriately accounts for the nonrandom probability of winning the World Cup. In this paper, I experiment with alternative
lag specifications in logged GDP on the right-hand side of Equation (1), in order to reduce
the risk of omitted variables in the baseline model. Furthermore, the next section presents
a more agnostic identification strategy which does not aim at modeling selection into
treatment explicitly, but rather compares countries with a similar evolution in GDP growth
up to the occurrence of each World Cup event. Reasonably, this approach identifies GDP
growth series affected by a similar set of factors, either observable or not, thus limiting
the relevance of any MA error structure considerably. Still, the Data S1 discusses the
results of a supplementary analysis which, using a multi-step approach, directly attempts
at identifying and filtering out the MA component of 4 GDPc,t before the estimation of
any treatment effect. Equation (1) is estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS) and SEs
are clustered at the country level.
Identification of βl in fact relies on three key assumptions: (i) parallel pre-trends; (ii) no
anticipation effects; (iii) and exogeneity of a World Cup victory. Intuitively, the parallel
trend assumption imposes that, prior to the football competition, countries winning the
World Cup do not display trends in GDP growth that systematically differ from those of
the control countries. Along the same lines, the absence of anticipation effects requires
GDP growth not to react before the World Cup is actually won by country c. Finally,
the exogeneity of a success in the World Cup assumes that the unobserved time-varying
factors which influence the likelihood of winning the World Cup do not affect GDP
growth either. Considering that, conditional on past GDP levels (proxied by the fourth
lag in logged GDP) and factors like the historical football culture of a nation (absorbed
by country fixed effects), a success in the World Cup is hardly predictable and often
determined by pseudo-random factors (e.g. drawings of teams, game-specific episodes),
all these requirements can be thought of as arguably satisfied.8
Synthetic DiD

Nevertheless, this paper implements even the synthetic DiD (SDiD) approach proposed
by Arkhangelsky et al. (2021), which combines features from Synthetic Control (Abadie
and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2010) and DiD (Ashenfelter
and Card, 1985, Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004) to model settings in which the
parallel trend assumption is potentially violated. Because the SDiD strategy requires a
reasonable pool of control units to construct an appropriate counterfactual trend in GDP
growth to that of the World Cup winners, the attention in the SDiD analysis will be
devoted only to the six World Cups held between 1994 and 2018.9 Indeed, GDP data
at quarterly frequency are available just for a limited number of countries prior to 1994
(more details are provided in section II).
See also Acemoglu et al. (2019), who rely on a similar identification strategy to study how transition to or away
from democracy affects growth.
Thus, the set of World Cup winners in the SDiD model is made of: France (1998 and 2018), Brazil (2002), Italy
(2006), Spain (2010) and Germany (2014).

Another challenge to estimate a SDiD model in the current framework is that France
won the World Cup both in 1998 and 2018 (i.e. multiple treatments at different timing).
To accommodate this feature of the data, the SDiD analysis will use a sample obtained by
splitting the GDP time series into national subseries of 10 quarters, each of them covering
the period around the running of a given World Cup. More specifically, for each country I
define GDP subseries which start in the seventh quarter prior (i.e. q = −7) and terminate
in the second quarter after (i.e. q = 2) the post-1994 World Cup that they refer to. Only
the subseries of the winning country which covers the period around the World Cup won
will be considered as affected by the treatment. In addition, this approach will permit the
SDiD strategy to estimate an average treatment effect in the very short run, which is the
only time window when the event-study design outlined in subsection II highlights an
increase in GDP growth due to victory in the World Cup (see section III).
As an example, the GDP time series of Spain is divided into six shorter time series.
The earliest subseries covers the period around the 1998 World Cup, by starting in the
third quarter of 1996 and ending in the fourth quarter of 1998. Instead, the most recent
subseries covers the period around the 2018 World Cup: it starts in the third quarter of
2016 and ends in the fourth quarter of 2018. Only one of these six subseries includes
the second quarter of 2010, when Spain won the first (and last, so far) World Cup of its
history. This latter subseries will be included in the set of treated series, denoted by N1 .
The remaining five subseries of Spain will be part of the control group N0 , which in total
will comprise 268 GDP subseries. The overall number of time series n used for the SDiD
analysis therefore results from the number of countries and their number of available
10-quarter subseries (N = N0 + N1 = 268 + 6 = 274). Hence, the total number of GDP
records used for the SDiD analysis is 2,740.
The SDID problem to solve can be written as:

⎭
(λ,β,α,μ) ⎩
n=1 q=−7

where λ is the average treatment effect of winning the World Cup in the two subsequent
quarters, while WINn,q is a static DiD indicator that takes value one after winning the
World Cup and 0 otherwise. The right-hand side of (2) does not include any indicator
for hosting the World Cup, since host countries do not represent good counterfactuals of
winning countries as they are themselves potentially affected by the event under study.
For this reason, the analysis described in this section is performed by discarding from the
sample the subseries n which belongs to country c and covers the quarter when the World
Cup was hosted by c (e.g. the subseries of Brazil covering the period around the 2014
World Cup held in Brazil).10
Similarly, (2) does not include any lag in logged GDP. Indeed, selection effects into
treatment are explicitly modeled by ω̂n and τˆq , which, respectively, denote subseriesspecific and relative quarter-specific synthetic weights. The objective of the former is to

create parallel trends in GDP growth in the eight pre-World Cup quarters between the
six treated subseries and a convex combination of the 268 control series. This goal is
achieved by solving a problem of the following form:

n0 =1

n1 =269

where the synthetic weights for the control series, ωn0 , vary and need to sum up to one,
while the six treated series receive the same weight. ω0 denotes an intercept term. Its
inclusion in (3) provides some flexibility with respect to the pre-trends of treated and
control series, which are not required to match perfectly (as in a standard synthetic control
model) but only to be parallel.11 Any constant difference between the two groups is in
fact controlled by the series-specific fixed effects, αn , included in (2). Instead, ζ is a
regularization parameter, which guarantees the uniqueness of the synthetic weights by
matching the average change in GDP growth of the control series.
On the other hand, the relative quarter-specific synthetic weights, τq , guarantee that
the post-World Cup GDP growth of each control series differs by up to a constant from
its average GDP growth in the pre-event period. Formally:
(τˆ0 , τ̂ ) = arg min

Again, the synthetic weights for the pre-World Cup period, τq with q ≤ 0, vary and
need to sum up to one. Instead, the two post-World Cup quarters receive an equal weight
of 0.5.
Data and samples

Time series data at quarterly frequency on GDP (and components) by country come from
the OECD quarterly national accounts (QNA) dataset. The event-study model, (1), is
estimated using a sample starting in 1961 and ending in 2021 inclusive. However, the
GDP time series provided by the OECD starts after 1961 for several countries. As a result
of this framework, the baseline sample is unbalanced and the GDP growth rates of only
a subset of the actual number of World Cup winners and hosts are observed around the
football tournament date. The information is summarized in Table A1.
Two countries of particular interest are Argentina and Brazil, which both won the
World Cup more than once but present a quarterly GDP series starting only in 1993 and
11 Another advantage of the algorithm developed by Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) is the possibility to estimate the
treatment effect of interest by exploiting information from all World Cup winners at once, while standard synthetic
control analyses often have to focus on settings in which only one unit is affected by the treatment of interest (see
for instance Billmeier and Nannicini, 2013 and Campos, Coricelli, and Moretti, 2019). Given the limited number of
countries for which GDP records are available at quarterly frequency, a synthetic control type of analysis for each
separate World Cup event would be severely underpowered.

1996, respectively.12 Since the 2022 Qatar World Cup is not part of the analysis and the
Argentinian GDP series starts 10 years later than its previous World Cup success (Mexico
1986), the analysis collocates Argentina in the set of control countries. On the contrary,
Brazil is collocated in the treated group and its GDP series hence starts only in the second
quarter of 1998, which corresponds to precisely four years after the victory in the 1994
World Cup held in the USA.
A breakdown between host, winning and control countries is provided in Table A2.
Six countries won at least one World Cup in the period when their GDP time series is
examined: England (in 1966), Germany (in 1974, 1990 and 2014), Italy (in 1982 and
2006), France (in 1998 and 2018), Brazil (in 2002) and Spain (in 2010). Twelve countries
hosted the World Cup. Thirty-six countries neither won nor hosted the World Cup in the
analysis window.
The event-study sample is made of 8,637 observations, with an average of about
180 quarterly GDP records per country. Summary statistics by winner status for both
the full sample and selected twenty-year periods are provided in Table 1, together
Another type of exception is England, which hosted and won the 1966 World Cup, but for which GDP data are

with a t-statistic testing whether mean differences are statistically significant. On
average, winning countries are characterized by larger populations and economies,
especially starting from the eighties when quarterly GDP records are available for most
countries.

III. Results
The economic effects of winning the World Cup

The main results of the event-study design are provided in Table 2. Most of the pre-victory
coefficients are not statistically different from zero. This finding indicates that, conditional
on past GDP levels and country fixed effects, the likelihood of winning the World Cup is
largely unrelated to GDP growth. On the contrary, national GDP displays an accelerated
growth in the first two quarters after success in the World Cup. More specifically, column
1 of Table 2 indicates that winning the World Cup causes quarterly GDP to grow by
0.454 and 0.683 percentage points in the first and second quarter following the football
competition, respectively. These effects are statistically significant at the 10% level and
indistinguishable from each other.13 However, GDP growth returns to the pre-World
Cup rate starting from the third quarter following the tournament: none of the remaining
posttreatment indicators are in fact statistically significant. Thus, winning the World Cup
seems to increase GDP growth only temporarily, with an effect that vanishes completely
already after two quarters.
Finally, the coefficient associated with the host dummy is negative and not statistically
significant. This finding is in line with the existing literature, as it confirms that there are
limited economic returns from the act of hosting the World Cup itself.
A magnifying lens on the short term

The results reported in section III suggest that winning the World Cup has only a weak and
short-lived positive effect on GDP growth, which seems to last for at most two quarters.
This section provides additional evidence in support of this finding, by focusing on a
narrower time window around the World Cup date and using the synthetic DiD approach
presented in section II. The results of this analysis are summarized in Figure 1.
The trend in GDP growth of the synthetic control resembles well that of the winning
country in the pretournament period. The two GDP growth series differ between each
other only by a term that seems constant over time. Instead, after the running of the World
Cup, the winning country presents a more pronounced GDP growth than its synthetic
control. The gap in YoY GDP growth between the average World Cup winner and its
counterfactual seems partially closed after two quarters from the World Cup. Overall, the
average treatment effect in the two post-World Cup periods is estimated to be of 0.481
percentage points in GDP growth, which is slightly lower than the one recorded by the
baseline event-study specification (see Table 2), but again statistically significant at the
10% level.

analysis, but using as outcome variables the growth rates of the following five GDP
components: private consumption, government consumption, capital formation, exports
and imports. The results of the event-study approach are summarized in Figure 2, while
the full set of coefficients is reported in Table A3.
The findings suggest that the effect on GDP growth is mainly determined by an increase
in export growth. The fourth panel of Figure 2 shows that export growth is, on average,
5.12 percentage points higher in the second quarter following the victory of the World
Cup. However, the growth rate of the export sector was already increasing for the winning
country in the quarters preceding the World Cup, which clearly represents a violation of
the parallel trend assumption. For this reason, the export time series is also examined
using the synthetic DiD approach, the results of which are summarized in Figure 3. This
strategy is considerably more successful in matching the pretrend in export growth rates
between the set of treated units and the set of control ones. In the post-World Cup period,
Figure 3 clearly shows how the export growth of the average winning country increases
sharply if compared to its counterfactual. However, the associated treatment effect (an
increase of 4.5 percentage points in export growth) is estimated very imprecisely and it is
not statistically significant.

The remaining panels of Figure 2 indicate that, following the victory of the World
Cup, capital formation increases only slightly, with such effects that are not statistically
significant. Winning the World Cup is also associated with an increase in import growth,
although this boost is less pronounced (1.43 percentage points) than that of the export
sector. Furthermore, it is noticeable from Table A3 how every GDP component presents
a negative and significant convergence coefficient, which is larger in magnitude for
capital formation and imports than for private consumption, government consumption
or exports. Finally, qualitatively similar patterns emerge from performing the synthetic
DiD strategy on each of these alternative outcomes, the results of which are displayed in
Figures A2–A5.

IV. Robustness checks
GDP dynamics

This section tests further the robustness of the results by providing a set of analyses that
deviate from equation (1) in the way they model GDP dynamics. Indeed, the inclusion

of the fourth lag in GDP as a covariate in equation (1) might not control for all the
economic factors which potentially correlate with both GDP growth and the probability
of success in the World Cup. Hence, it is important to investigate how the estimates
of the baseline coefficients change when modelling the GDP dynamics with alternative
specifications.
To begin, column 1 of Table A4 reports estimates after excluding the fourth lag in
GDP from the set of control variables. The rationale of this sensitivity check is that lagged
GDP may be in turn affected by the event under study, thus potentially representing a
‘bad control’ in the model and leading to the contamination of the main estimates of
interest. However, the event-study coefficients provided in column 1 are very similar to
the baseline ones displayed in Table 2. Hence, the findings of this paper do not rely on the
inclusion of lagged GDP in the regression model, even though this control variable is a
significant predictor of current GDP growth and possibly of the likelihood of winning the
World Cup.
Columns 2-4 of Table A4 experiment by replacing the fourth lag in logged GDP with
respectively the third, fifth and sixth lag in logged GDP. All models report findings that
are in line with the rest of the paper. This fact suggests that the order of the lag does not
matter, provided that it is sufficiently predetermined to the first two quarters following the
World Cup.
Instead, column 4 includes all the first six lags as controls, thus modeling GDP
dynamics with a rich autoregressive specification similar to Acemoglu et al. (2019). The
results of this model should be taken with caution, since the inclusion of the very first
lags in GDP is likely to impact directly the temporary treatment effect identified by the
event-study indicators. The coefficients reported in column 5 highlight an increase in GDP
growth only in the first quarter following the World Cup, which however is statistically
significant at the 1% level.
Column 6 provides results for a model in which the fourth lag in logged GDP gets
interacted with decade dummies, in order to capture the potential time-varying evolution
of convergence effects. Indeed, a current debate in the convergence literature is about
whether convergence patterns have changed over time (see for instance Acemoglu and
Molina, 2021 and Kremer, Willis, and You, 2022). The coefficients of these interaction
terms indicate that, if anything, the convergence phenomenon has sharpened over the last
thirty years. Nevertheless, the event-study indicators associated with the first two quarters
after the victory of the World Cup remain positive and statistically significant at the 10%
level. Thus, the possible time-varying nature of convergence patterns does not represent
an issue for the conclusions of this study. Overall, the set of results reported in this section
confirms the existence of a short-lived boost to national GDP due to a success in the
World Cup.
Country selection

Another concern related to the results presented so far is that they are obtained from a
sample of countries that is quite heterogeneous. For instance, the control group listed
in Table A2 consists of countries that are generally considered to have virtually no

chance to either win or host a World Cup. As a result, the same countries might have
experienced alternative types of treatment related to the World Cup, such as an against
any odds qualification to the final stage of the tournament or a better ranking placement
compared to the expectations. These instances can all represent a confounding factor in the
analysis.
For this reason, the current section provides a robustness check in which the baseline
event-study model, (1), is estimated using a smaller and more homogeneous sample of
countries. For each World Cup under study, I select the two control countries that—in the
year prior to the football event—resemble the most the World Cup winner in either yearly
GDP levels or total population. If a control country is selected as the nearest neighbour
of a World Cup winner more than once, its GDP time series is duplicated accordingly
(i.e. matching with replacement). Then, I estimate (1) using only the sample made of
World Cup winners and matched control countries. This alternative subgroup of control
countries certainly presents more similarities to the sample of World Cup winners listed
in Table A2, thus allowing to verify whether the heterogeneity in the baseline sample
poses a risk to identification.
Results are summarized by Figure 4, the notes of which fully specify the outcome of
the matching procedure. For instance, Mexico turns out to be the most similar control
country to a World Cup winner in terms of GDP levels. Indeed, it is chosen 8 times as
the nearest GDP neighbour. Instead, Turkey best resembles World Cup winners in terms
of total population, by being selected six times as the control country with the closest
population size. Nevertheless, estimating (1) following these matching algorithms makes
the first two post-World Cup indicators highly significant. Their associated coefficients
are even larger in magnitude than those reported in Table 2 (see Table A5). Thus, the
differences between treated and control countries do not seem to represent an issue for the
conclusions of this study.

Media coverage of the World Cup finalists

Since the treatment effect estimated in this paper seems primarily linked to the export
sector, a natural question is whether the goods and services produced by the World Cup
winner simply benefit from the unique visibility offered by the final game of the World
Cup, which is an event generally viewed by more than 1 billion people worldwide. Large
companies which operate internationally may be willing to exploit the reaching of the final
by the national team, for instance through the purchase of advertising space on foreign
broadcasters in order to increase their global market shares.
To investigate whether this potential mechanism is at play, this section presents
the results of a standard difference-in-difference (DiD) model which compares the
growth rates of World Cup winners and runners-up. Reasonably, these two groups
of countries enjoy a similar amount and type of media coverage on the day(s) of
the final. Furthermore, their national teams played the same and maximum possible
number of World Cup games, which are a potential source of distraction for the
population. Consequently, reaching the World Cup final may reduce productivity levels
and induce a (negative) anticipation effect on GDP growth. Thus, the World Cup

that is, βl . The control group is chosen based on a matching algorithm (with replacement) selecting the control

levels (bottom panel). The control group matched by GDP levels comprises: Canada; India; Indonesia (×2);

runners-up provide an ideal counterfactual to test the economic effects of winning the
World Cup.
To do so, I first pool together all the available subseries used for the SDiD analysis
and retain only those associated with the pair of finalists in a given World Cup (e.g. the
subseries of France and Italy around the 2006 World Cup). Then, I estimate a similar
specification to (1) which replaces the event-study indicators with their static counterpart,
WINn,q , in order to estimate the average treatment effect in the two post-World Cup
quarters.14
The results and additional details on this analysis are provided in Table 3. The first
column displays a positive and statistically significant effect (at the 10% level) on YoY
GDP growth for the World Cup winner, which is twice as large as the SDiD estimate
reported in Figure 3 and closer to the post-matching ATT displayed in Figure 4. Again,
most of this effect appears driven by the export sector, the growth rate of which increases
by up to 6.36 percentage points on average.15 Hence, the findings of this paper cannot be
explained by the exceptional media coverage devoted to the World Cup finalists in the
run-up to the final.
14 Importantly, the analysis described in this section makes use of only the World Cups around which I can
observe the GDP levels of both the winner and the runner-up.
15 However, this time the analysis highlights even a weak increase in both private and government consumption.

V. Conclusions
Every four years, media outlets and analysts claim that the men’s FIFA World Cup
winner will experience a boost in GDP as a result of a wave of national pride which
translates into higher economic activity. However, robust evidence in this respect is
relatively scarce. This paper has investigated if winning the World Cup actually involves
a positive effect on GDP growth, by using time series data provided by the OECD and
implementing both an event-study design and the synthetic DiD approach proposed by
Arkhangelsky et al. (2021). Importantly, the econometric strategy makes use of a variety
of dynamic model specifications to control for past GDP levels, which not only determine
the probability of winning major sport competitions as documented by Bernard and
Busse (2004), but also affect the current rate of economic growth (Barro, 1991, Barro and
Sala-i Martin, 1992).
The analysis has shown that winning the World Cup leads to a statistically significant
increase in GDP growth only in the two quarters following the victory of the World
Cup. Over this period, YoY GDP growth is, according to the most conservative estimates
produced by this study, 0.48 percentage points higher if compared to a counterfactual
situation in which the World Cup had not been won. This effect seems to be driven
by enhanced export growth, which possibly results from the greater international appeal
enjoyed by a country after winning the most renowned among the football competitions.
Similar arguments are at least sponsored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
to promote bids and projects for hosting the Olympic Games, which is certainly an
opportunity for a country to be in the global spotlight.16 Moreover, an expected boost
to exports is mentioned by Preuss (2004) as one of the reasons behind the decision of
the South Korean government to host in Seoul the 1988 Games, which were supposed to
‘raise international awareness of Korean manufactured products’. Similarly to Bayar and
Schaur (2014), the current paper argues that a visibility channel of this sort may apply
even to the winner of a major sport event.

The findings perhaps clash with the general pessimism of the literature on the economic
returns of major sport events, which in multiple occasions resulted in an unprofitable
enterprise for the host country (Hagn and Maennig, 2008, Baade and Matheson, 2016).
Indeed, this analysis suggests that winning a major sport competition might lead to a
short-lived economic boost, without the need to incur the financial burden which is usually
associated with its organization. Overall, the results provided in this study have shed some
light on a publicly debated issue that ends up influencing macroeconomic forecasts and,
consequently, policymaking. Moreover, they assume particular relevance in light of the
recent FIFA proposal to make the World Cup a more frequent event, which supposedly
should take place every 2 years.

the 1998 World Cup, because France was both the host and the winner of the 1998 World Cup. The solid red
line displays the GDP growth of the average World Cup winning subseries. The blue dashed line displays the
GDP growth of its synthetic counterfactual. Standard errors are clustered at the country-subseries level and
obtained via 1,000 bootstrap replications. The green areas at the bottom of the figure measure the time-specific
synthetic weights, as estimated by equation (4). The analysis uses 10-quarter GDP subseries around the six
World Cups held between 1998 and 2018. The total number of GDP records used is 2,730 (i.e. 273 GDP
subseries)

Notes: GDP start denotes the first record of the GDP time series of each World Cup winner or host starting from
1961. The in-sample column indicates whether the quarterly GDP time series of a given country is available during
the period when the country hosted or won the World Cup.
∗
The GDP time series used for England is that of the UK as a whole.
† The GDP series of Brazil is let it start in the second quarter of 1998, namely 4 years after its victory in the 1994
World Cup.

Notes: OLS estimates for the event-study model obtained by using a more homogeneous sample of countries. The
control group is chosen based on a matching algorithm (with replacement) selecting the control countries that are
most similar to World Cup winners in terms of either GDP levels (columns 1 and 2) or population levels (columns
3 and 4). The control group matched by GDP levels comprises: Canada; India; Indonesia (×2); Japan (×3); Korea;
Mexico (×8); Russia (×4). The control group matched by population levels comprises: Colombia; Indonesia; Japan;
Korea (×3); Mexico (×4); Russia; South Africa (×3); Turkey (×6). Clustered SEs by country are reported in
parenthesis.
Significance levels: ∗ P < 0.1; ∗∗ p<0.05; ∗∗∗ p<0.01.
