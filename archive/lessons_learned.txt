Lessons Learned
===============

1. Two competing effects when computing YoY for the paper sample
----------------------------------------------------------------
The paper's estimation sample uses Δ4 log GDP growth, which requires a
4-quarter lag.  There are two groups of countries that behave differently:

  a) EARLY-START countries (OECD data from 1960-Q1, paper window 1961+):
     The paper does NOT include 1961 YoY values.  Even though 1960 data
     exists in OECD, the paper's effective first YoY quarter is 1962-Q1
     (whose lag at 1961-Q1 is the first quarter in the stated window).
     This means the paper treats the sample window as the boundary for
     lag availability.

  b) LATE-START countries (BRA 1998-Q2, ARG 1993-Q1, RUS 1995-Q1, CHL 1996-Q1):
     The paper DOES include their first 4 quarters of YoY.  For example,
     Brazil's GDP series "starts" at 1998-Q2 per Table A1, but OECD has
     Brazilian GDP from 1996-Q1.  So the YoY at 1998-Q2 uses the 1997-Q2
     lag (available in OECD but before the stated start date).

The correct approach (variant E in investigate_missing_8_obs.R):
  - Keep master-panel YoY (computed on all available OECD data)
  - Apply per-country effective start dates:
      * Most countries: 1962-Q1 (not 1961-Q1)
      * BRA: 1998-Q2, ARG: 1993-Q1, RUS: 1995-Q1, CHL: 1996-Q1
  - Then filter for non-NA YoY

This yields W=1295, NW=7338 (paper: W=1295, NW=7342).  The 4 missing
non-winner obs are likely Russia, whose OECD data in our download ends
in 2020 rather than 2021.

2. The paper only documents series ranges for a few countries
-------------------------------------------------------------
Table A1 in Mello (2024) lists the GDP start quarter only for countries
whose series begin later than 1961-Q1 (BRA, ARG, RUS, CHL).  For the
majority of countries the paper simply states "1961-Q1" as the start,
without explaining that YoY growth is only defined from 1962-Q1 onward.
This is an implicit convention: the sample window defines when lags are
available, not external data availability — but only for the 1960-start
countries.  Late-start countries use external OECD data for their lags.

3. Observation counts as a diagnostic
-------------------------------------
Comparing observation counts (winners / non-winners) against the paper's
Table 1 is a quick way to verify correct sample construction.

  Paper:     W = 1,295    NW = 7,342    Total = 8,637
  Ours:      W = 1,295    NW = 7,338    Total = 8,633

The initial ~24-obs discrepancy (1315 vs 1295 winners) pointed to the
1961 YoY issue.  The remaining 4 non-winner obs are attributable to
Russia's shorter OECD series in our data download.

4. Pipeline history
-------------------
  v1: YoY computed on full OECD → trim to 1961+  →  too many obs (1315 W)
  v2: trim to 1961+ → recompute YoY in window    →  too few obs (1291 W)
  v3: master YoY + Table A1 start dates           →  correct (1295 W)

5. FIFA World Rankings vs ELO ratings for World Cup underperformance
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We built a dataset of World Cup "underperformers" — teams ranked in the
top 10 (among WC participants) before the tournament that were eliminated
in the group stage.  Two ranking systems were compared:

  a) ELO ratings (eloratings.net):  Available for all 16 WCs (1962–2022).
     Scraped from undocumented TSV endpoint:
       https://www.eloratings.net/YYYY_World_Cup_start.tsv

  b) FIFA World Rankings (inside.fifa.com API):  Available for 8 WCs
     (1994–2022, rankings started Dec 1992).  Scraped from:
       https://inside.fifa.com/api/ranking-overview?locale=en&dateId=...
     The dateId parameter uses two schemes:
       - Sequential: id1–id152  (Dec 1992 – Jan 2007)
       - Epoch-based: id{days since 1985-01-01}  (2007 onward)
     There is no API endpoint to list available dateIds — they had to be
     discovered by probing.

The two systems are quite consistent.  Spearman rank correlations among
WC participants range from 0.63 (1998) to 0.90 (2018), with a clear
upward trend — the systems have been converging over time.  Mean absolute
rank difference dropped from ~6.4 (1998) to ~3.0 (2022).

Out of 8 WCs with both rankings, only 5 cases had a different
underperformance label (top-10 ELO vs top-10 FIFA).  All 5 were teams
ranked top-10 by ELO but outside the top 10 by FIFA:
  - 1994: Colombia (ELO 5, FIFA 14), Russia (ELO 10, FIFA 15)
  - 1998: Spain (ELO 3, FIFA 14)
  - 2002: Croatia (ELO 7, FIFA 16)
  - 2022: Uruguay (ELO 10, FIFA 13)
In every case, FIFA ranked these teams notably lower than ELO did.
ELO tends to be more generous to historically strong teams, while FIFA
rankings reflect more recent form.
