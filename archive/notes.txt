How Major Sporting Tournaments Affect Patriotism and National Pride
Executive summary

Across the best-identified empirical literature, elite-sport tournaments can measurably move patriotism / national pride / national identification, but the typical pattern is short-lived “spikes” rather than durable shifts—and effects depend strongly on context and measurement.

The most rigorous evidence is concentrated in football (soccer). Quasi-experimental designs around match outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa show that national team victories can shift identification away from ethnic identity toward national identity and increase inter-ethnic trust, with additional downstream reductions in conflict.

For FIFA World Cups specifically, evidence combining surveys “around” the event indicates a pronounced during-tournament rise in national pride that largely recedes after the event (e.g., Germany 2006), while longer-horizon resident surveys in a host-country context (South Africa 2010) find increased “psychic income” (pride/euphoria) but mixed or even negative movement in some social-capital dimensions.

The same identity surge that can support “inclusive” nation-building can also heighten exclusionary nationalism and related behaviors (e.g., more negative views of refugees’ contribution to national diversity after a narrow win in a major football match; and evidence connecting World Cup-related nationalism to greater interstate aggression in certain contexts).
Information needs and research approach

Key information needs for a rigorous, thesis-ready synthesis (scope: “tournaments → patriotism”):

    Credible identification strategies (panel, event-study, DiD, RD, survey experiments) that isolate tournament shocks from confounding time trends.
    Clear operationalizations of patriotism (national pride items, national identification indices, symbolic/behavioral proxies, resource-allocation preferences).
    Comparable effect sizes and time horizons (hours/days vs weeks vs months/years), plus decay vs persistence.
    Evidence on heterogeneity (demographics, baseline attachment, tournament salience, political regime, host vs non-host, “win” vs “participate/qualify”).
    Cross-event contrasts: multi-sport mega-events vs football generally vs FIFA World Cups.

Connector-first step (per request): Only the GitHub connector was enabled (repository: saiboT-Damaske/The-Effect-of-Winning-a-World-Cup). The repository’s thesis materials focus on macroeconomic outcomes of a FIFA World Cup victory (e.g., GDP growth) and primarily cite causal inference method papers (event-study, synthetic DiD) rather than patriotism/sports-nationalism literatures. This is evident from the bibliography and methodological/theoretical-background chapters.
Because the repository did not provide a substantive patriotism-focused bibliography, the core evidence below comes from targeted web-based discovery of high-quality empirical studies.

Ready-to-paste synthesis paragraph contrasting A vs B vs C

Across large sporting tournaments, the most consistent finding is a short-term increase in national pride/patriotism or national identification salience, with limited evidence of long-run persistence without reinforcement. For multi-sport mega-events, resident surveys and media-exposure studies show very high pride-related responses (e.g., high agreement that the Olympics increase local pride in Beijing) and associations between Olympic media consumption and nationalism/patriotism, but identification is often correlational or anticipatory rather than causal. In contrast, football/soccer tournaments provide stronger quasi-experimental evidence: national team victories in sub-Saharan Africa shift identity away from ethnic attachments toward national identity, increase inter-ethnic trust, and reduce subsequent conflict in close-qualification settings, effects that are not explained by generic euphoria. However, soccer wins can also heighten exclusionary reactions toward foreign out-groups unless the victory is framed inclusively. For FIFA World Cups specifically, national pride can rise sharply during the tournament and then revert toward baseline after it ends (Germany 2006), while host-nation panel-type evidence from South Africa 2010 shows increased pride/euphoria (“psychic income”) but mixed changes in social cohesion proxies and, in certain contexts, potential spillovers into more aggressive interstate behavior linked to World Cup nationalism shocks.
Evidence gaps and thesis-relevant robustness checks

The evidence base is rich on “short-run salience” but thinner on long-run persistence and on separating winning vs hosting vs merely participating. Across many studies, measurement is also heterogeneous (pride items vs identity indices vs WTP vs behavioral proxies), limiting direct meta-analytic pooling without full-text extraction.

Robustness checks that are especially thesis-relevant:

    Pre-trend and placebo timing tests: apply pseudo-event dates (random match days) and pseudo-wins to verify that estimated pride/identity shifts do not appear absent the tournament shock (especially in DiD/event-study designs).
    Alternative control windows: compare immediate effects (hours/days) with longer windows (weeks/months) to quantify decay rather than assuming it.
    Mechanism falsification: test whether effects are explained by generic mood/optimism; the strongest football paper explicitly tackles this, and similar checks should be replicated where possible.
    Heterogeneity discipline: preregister (or at least restrict) subgroup analyses (gender, income, migration background, baseline identification, regime type, soccer popularity) because many credible effects are conditional.
    Out-group vs in-group outcomes together: jointly estimate pride and out-group attitudes to detect whether “nation-building” is inclusive (inter-ethnic trust) or exclusionary (refugee cultural-threat narratives).
    Measurement harmonization strategy: map each paper’s outcome to a common latent construct (e.g., “national identity salience,” “constructive patriotism,” “exclusionary nationalism”) and report results by construct family rather than forcing a single scalar effect size.
