# Tables in This Folder

## Available Tables
- `table1_summary_statistics.tex` - Summary statistics by winner status (from Mello replication)

## LaTeX Usage

Include tables with:

```latex
\input{tables/table1_summary_statistics}
```

Note: Most tables in the thesis are currently defined inline using `tabular` environments. 
If you want to externalize them, save the table content here as `.tex` files and use `\input{}`.
